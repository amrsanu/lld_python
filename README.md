# Low-Level Design (LLD) Examples in Python

This repository contains examples of Low-Level Design (LLD) implemented in Python. LLD focuses on the detailed design of individual components of a system, including class design, data structures, algorithms, and module-level architecture.

Understanding LLD is crucial for building robust, maintainable, and scalable software. These examples aim to illustrate key LLD principles and patterns through practical implementations.

## Current Examples

*   **Movie Booking System:** A detailed example demonstrating the LLD of a simple movie booking system, including classes for movies, cinemas, shows, seats, bookings, and users.

## Topics to Cover Before Starting

Before diving into the LLD examples, it's beneficial to have a grasp of the following general topics:

*   **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles:** Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction.
*   **UML Diagrams:** Class diagrams and sequence diagrams for visualizing design.
*   **Design Patterns:** Common solutions to recurring design problems (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer).
*   **Data Structures and Algorithms:** Choosing appropriate structures and algorithms for efficiency.
*   **Code Modularity and Reusability:** Designing components that are independent and reusable.
*   **Error Handling and Exception Management:** Strategies for dealing with errors gracefully.
*   **Testing:** Writing unit tests and integration tests to ensure correctness.
*   **Code Style and Best Practices:** Writing clean, readable, and maintainable code (e.g., PEP 8 for Python).
